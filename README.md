# Sequence-Based Prediction of Protein Secondary Structure
Summer Siege 2025

## Problem Statement:
Develop a high-accuracy machine learning model
to predict the three-state secondary structure (α-
helix [H], β-sheet [E], or coil [C]) of individual
amino acids in a protein using only its raw
sequence data, without requiring evolutionary or
homologous sequence information. The model
should address key challenges in computational
biology while minimizing reliance on domainspecific
biological knowledge.
